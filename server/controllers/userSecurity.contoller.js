/**
 * User Security Dashboard Controller
 *
 * Simple Explanation:
 * This controller handles all security dashboard  requests from regular users:
 *   - Show me my security dashboard --> Get overview, devices, activity
 *   - Remove my trusted device --> Delete specific device
 *   - Show my login history --> Get detailed login timeline
 *   - Get my security settings --> Current security configuration
 *
 * WHY SEPARATE FROM ADMIN?
 *  - Users can only see THEIR OWN DATA
 *  - Different permissions than admin
 *  - Focused on personal security management
 *
